### Hi there, I'm Femi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer who develops backend solutions, services and desktop applications with PHP and C#. 
I previously worked on legacy code, which I really learned a great deal from. I have written documentation for existing codebases, secured and integrated existing APIs while working with a team of amazing engineers. 
I enjoy working with scripting languages and backend/server-side development and fixing bugs and motivating others. I answer questions on StackOverflow to learn and improve my skills.
